Some readers may be disappointed with our reticence to penetrate deeper into such mechanisms. We too are disappointed. However, we are limited in how much we can answer such questions based on available diagnostic output from the simulations. Nonetheless, this excuse, which is in fact ubiquitous in such comparison papers utilizing CORE or CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) simulations, is unsatisfying.

The conclusions reached in the house of cards constructed above are that the wind strengthens the heat flux, the Kelvin wave's crest weakens it, and tropical instability waves do not have a dominant effect. We advance this argument as a working hypothesis for future study, not as a strongly supported conclusion.

Before and during a second cruise of April 1987, we were most curious whether we would find the deep diurnal cycle again. Our hopes were severely dimmed when we decided to surrender to the numerous sharks attacking our small advanced microstructure profiler(AMP) and to operate only the more imposing autonomous multiscaleprofiler(MSP). This meant reducing the profiling rate from4 per hour to 6 per day! To our surprise, the time series of the dissipation rate showed an unmistakable diurnal variation despite the coarse time resolution, and the signal reached well belowthe mixed layer depth as depicted in Figure lb.

AMP observations were taken while the ship drifted "in the trough" near the buoy (a procedure that is better for collecting data than keeping the crew happy). (Following a moderately rough transit to the site, our sampling method prompted the chief engineer to call us "a fistful of weirdos".)

    When I emphasise the imperfection of observing techniques, perhaps I should say that I wrote this chapter during a succession of midnight-todawn watches during an attempt to survey the Somali Current near Socotra in the heart of the southwest monsoon. It is rather quixotic to try to get the measure of so large a phenomenon armed only with a 12-knot vessel and some reversing thermometers. Clearly some important phenomena slip through the observational net, and nothing makes one more convinced of the inadequacy of present-day observing techniques than the tedious experience of garnering a slender harvest of thermometer readings and water samples from a rather unpleasant little ship at sea. A few good and determined engineers could revolutionise this backwards field.

  Lest there be any misunderstanding, we must emphasize at this point that "less sensitive" does not mean "insensitive". If CO_2 were a gray gas, then doubling its concentration, as we are poised to do within the century, would be unquestionably lethal. Because CO_2 is not in fact a gray gas, the results may be merely catastrophic.

   GFD models like this one often suffer from lack of relevance. A sign of this is that an investigator cannot find observations quite ideal enough to test his theory. Our guilt would be established, therefore, if we required a resting ocean with uniform stratification and a step-function wind to make any use of observations. Luckily this is not our position, for account can be taken of arbitrary stratification, pre-existing currents, and a stress that varies in time

   The following analogy illustrates the utility of buoyancy as a marker of water masses. Imagine a slightly tilted pile of Dutch pancakes sweetened with Canadian maple syrup. As the maple syrup is poured onto the top pancake, it readily spills over the sides but only slowly penetrates through to the interior. The disparate syrup transport arises because there is enhanced resistance to movement through a pancake but little resistance to movement along a pancake surface. We make use of this pancake analogy to conceptualize the stratification of ocean buoyancy and its influence on the associated transport of matter and heat.

    In 1979, Carl Wunsch famously asserted “Many sources for the internal wave field have been proposed; but it has not yet been possible to make the kind of statement that can be made about surface waves: namely, when the wind blows surface waves are generated and the larger the fetch and duration, the larger the waves.”

  the true relationship between spectrum and color turns out to be rather useful here. We are used to interpreting small differences from white light (“red” noise) as colors, so if the sea level spectrum was exactly “red” noise, a translation into a light spectrum would render it as a gray scale: low‐amplitude variability would be black, and high‐amplitude white, with grays at intermediate values.

  While a zipper makes a closure by the functioning of a single accurate mechanism, the same task can be accomplished by the closing of enough of the myriad tiny hooks and eyes that make up a strip of Velcro. Baker (1983) first used this analogy to suggest "the importance of many relatively cheap measurements that cover a broad area as opposed to expensive detailed measurements at a point." As an example, consider the merits of the plentiful satellite measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) compared with highly accurate but exceedingly sparse shipboard SST measurements. Satellite information on the spatial patterns of SST and the changes of these patterns in space and time have provided a revolutionary new view of the ocean—a view completely unattainable from SST measurements along ship tracks. In such "Velcro" techniques, the quantity of measurements allows a description of the spatial patterns associated with the underlying fluid flows, with detail impossible to obtain from sparse sampling. As has been the case with satellite SST, the quantitative accuracy of the remote sensing algorithm is determined and improved by comparison with "ground-truth" data from accurate but sparsely distributed sensors.

  The above analogy is of direct relevance to present state-of-the-art measurement of ocean turbulence, a field in which the accurate "zippers" are microscale profilers. While such profilers have become somewhat more common during the last decade, they remain relatively rare; are expensive to maintain and run; and in operation are often restricted by adverse conditions of weather, surface waves, or oceanic velocity shears.

  That turbulent mixing processes in the ocean are extremely important in determining the oceanic general circulation, and are major limiting factors in the ability to calculate future climate states, is a cliche in oceanography and climate dynamics. Unlike some other hackneyed statements, this one does retain much of its validity.

  The obliquity modulation of tidal mixing by a few percent and the associated  modulation in the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) may play a role comparable to the obliquity modulation of the incoming solar radiation (insolation), a cornerstone of the Milanković theory of ice ages. This speculation involves even more than the usual number of uncertainties found in climate speculations.

  Turbulence is rent by factionalism. Traditional approaches in the field are under attack, and one hears intemperate statements against long time averaging, Reynolds decomposition, and so forth. Some of these are reminiscent of the Einstein-Heisenberg controversy over quantum mechanics, and smack of a mistrust of any statistical approach. Coherent structure people sound like /The Emperor’s New Clothes/ when they say that all turbulent flows consist primarily of coherent structures, in the face of visual evidence to the contrary. Dynamical systems theory people are sure that turbulence is chaos. Simulators have convinced many that we will be able to compute /anything/ within a decade. Modeling is thus attacked as unnecessary, or irrelevant because it starts with Reynolds stress averaging or ignores coherent structures. The card-carrying physicists dismiss everything that has been done on turbulence from Osborne Reynolds until the last decade. Cellular Automata were hailed on their appearance as the answer to a maiden’s prayer, so far as turbulence was concerned. It is no wonder that funding agencies are confused.

  At the same time, the epiphanies, new ideas and novel observations that fundamentally drive the field forward frequently come not from big science, but from a cornucopia of much smaller exploratory efforts and the continued small-scale development of innovative observing technology and numerical techniques.

  The resulting shape is schematic and cartoonlike but is still recognizable as an elephant. Although the use of the Fourier coordinate expansion is not new, our approach clearly demonstrates its usefulness in reducing the number of parameters needed to describe a two-dimensional contour. In the special case of fitting an elephant, it is even possible to lower it to four complex parameters and therein implement a well-known saying.
