  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Turbulence is rent by factionalism. Traditional approaches in the field are under attack, and one hears intemperate statements against long time averaging, Reynolds decomposition, and so forth. Some of these are reminiscent of the Einstein-Heisenberg controversy over quantum mechanics, and smack of a mistrust of any statistical approach. Coherent structure people sound like /The Emperor’s New Clothes/ when they say that all turbulent flows consist primarily of coherent structures, in the face of visual evidence to the contrary. Dynamical systems theory people are sure that turbulence is chaos. Simulators have convinced many that we will be able to compute /anything/ within a decade. Modeling is thus attacked as unnecessary, or irrelevant because it starts with Reynolds stress averaging or ignores coherent structures. The card-carrying physicists dismiss everything that has been done on turbulence from Osborne Reynolds until the last decade. Cellular Automata were hailed on their appearance as the answer to a maiden’s prayer, so far as turbulence was concerned. It is no wonder that funding agencies are confused. (quoted in Cantwell 1990, p. 97)

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A second and, in my opinion, more persuasive argument for our studies is that, in sensitive systems, a small quantitative error may lead to large qualitative errors^1.

  Most floats sampled at regular pressure levels, though the Canadian Argo floats often sampled at irregular pressures and required substantial editing.

  A frequently asked question related to this work is “Which mixing processes matter most for climate?”. As with many alluringly comprehensive sounding questions, the answer is “it depends”.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  At the same time, the epiphanies, new ideas and novel observations that fundamentally drive the field forward frequently come not from big science, but from a cornucopia of much smaller exploratory efforts and the continued small-scale development of innovative observing technology and numerical techniques.  We must not lose the ability to be surprised.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The resulting shape is schematic and cartoonlike but is still recognizable as an elephant. Although the use of the Fourier coordinate expansion is not new, our approach clearly demonstrates its usefulness in reducing the number of parameters needed to describe a two-dimensional contour. In the special case of fitting an elephant, it is even possible to lower it to four complex parameters and therein implement a well-known saying.
  #+END_QUOTE
  With five, they give the elephant an eye and make it's trunk wiggle!
