* Death in the Gulf Stream

From [[http://kottke.org/17/01/ernest-hemingways-cocktail-recipe-for-bad-times][Kottke]] who got it from [[https://qz.com/889794/trump-inauguration-ernest-hemingway-has-a-cocktail-recipe-for-days-when-youve-had-just-enough-of-the-world/][Quartz]], a cocktail recipe created by Ernest Hemingway in 1937.

    Take a tall thin water tumbler and fill it with finely cracked ice.

    Lace this broken debris with 4 good purple splashes of Angostura, add the juice and crushed peel of 1 green lime, and fill glass almost full with Holland gin…

    No sugar, no fancying. It’s strong, it’s bitter—but so is English ale strong and bitter, in many cases.

    We don’t add sugar to ale, and we don’t need sugar in a “Death in the Gulf Stream”—or at least not more than 1 tsp. Its tartness and its bitterness are its chief charm.

A fitting cocktail for the oceanographer, XBTs, lost moorings and maybe a few ARGO floats?
