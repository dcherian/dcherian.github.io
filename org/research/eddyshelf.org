Advised by Ken Brink (WHOI), I studied the interaction of eddies with continental shelf-slope topography. I used the [[http://www.myroms.org][ROMS ocean model]] to simulate the interaction in an extremely idealized manner.

The following video shows the evolution of a passive tracer initialized to the initial latitude location of a water parcel. The coast is at the southern boundary; and horizontal lines are isobaths. The time series is the cross-shelfbreak flux of shelf-water (defined as water parcels starting on the shelf at $t=0$.)
