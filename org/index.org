*** Mixing measurements in the Bay of Bengal

   With [[http://people.oregonstate.edu/~shroyere/Welcome.html][Emily Shroyer (OSU)]] & the [[http://mixing.coas.oregonstate.edu/][OSU Ocean Mixing Group]].

   We are studying measurements of mixing from [[http://mixing.coas.oregonstate.edu/papers/mixing_measurements.pdf][χ-pod sensors]] deployed in the Bay of Bengal as part of the RAMA array.

*** Inertial-gravity waves in the equatorial Pacific

   Satellite observations give humanity an unprecedented detailed look at the surface ocean. The vertical structure of variability associated with surface signals is relatively less known, and the relevance of theoretical structures derived using strict assumptions is debated; viz., the so-called baroclinic vertical modes.

   Motivated by the [zonal wavenumber]-frequency spectra of dynamic height calculated by [[doi:10.1175/JPO-D-11-0235.1][Farrar & Durland (2012)]] --- see image on right ---  my goal is to infer the vertical structure of 7-day period inertial-gravity waves in the equatorial Pacific (filter band marked by horizontal lines). I am using long term subsurface temperature measurements and inferred dynamic height from [[http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/drupal/disdel/][the TAO/TRITON project]].

*** Shelf-water export by mesoscale eddies

Advisor: [[http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=23355][Ken Brink (WHOI)]] | [[doi:10.1175/JPO-D-16-0085.1][Read the paper!]] | [[file:static/ew-34-csdye.mp4][Video]] | [[file:research/eddyshelf.org][More detail]]

My dissertation looked at the interaction of deep-ocean mesoscale eddies with continental shelf-slope topography.

When visualized using passive tracer fields (red tracks eddy water and blue, shelf-slope water), the interaction clearly results in the formation of smaller-scale secondary vortices. We term these 'stacked' vortices to reflect their (unexpected) vertical structure wherein shelf-slope water is stacked over eddy water.

While at MIT, I took the semester-long [[https://tll.mit.edu/help/graduate-student-teaching-certificate-program][Teaching Certificate Program]]. I learned that it is generally more effective to have students work through a derivation primarily on their own in class with hints. Following that advice, I created worksheets that guide students through a derivation, guiding them toward important implications and reasoning for various steps. Here are the ones I have so far.
