*** Mixing measurements in the Bay of Bengal

   With [[http://people.oregonstate.edu/~shroyere/Welcome.html][Emily Shroyer (OSU)]]

   We are studying measurements of mixing from χ-pod sensors deployed in the Bay of Bengal as part of the Air-Sea Interaction Regional Initiative (ASIRI).

*** Inertial-gravity waves in the equatorial Pacific

   With [[http://www.whoi.edu/profile/tfarrar/][Tom Farrar (WHOI)]] & [[http://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/profile/durland/][Ted Durland (OSU)]].

   Satellite observations give humanity an unprecedented detailed look at the surface ocean. The vertical structure of variability associated with surface signals is relatively less known, and the relevance of theoretical structures derived using strict assumptions is debated; viz., the so-called baroclinic vertical modes.

   Motivated by [zonal wavenumber]-frequency spectra of [[doi:10.1175/JPO-D-11-0235.1][Farrar & Durland (2012)]], I am attempting to infer the vertical structure of 7-day period inertial-gravity waves in the equatorial Pacific.

*** Shelf-water export by mesoscale eddies

Advisor: [[http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=23355][Ken Brink (WHOI)]] | [[doi:10.1175/JPO-D-16-0085.1][Read the paper!]] | [[file:static/ew-34-csdye.mp4][Video!]]

My dissertation looked at the interaction of deep-ocean mesoscale eddies with continental shelf-slope topography.

When visualized using passive tracer fields (red tracks eddy water and blue, shelf-slope water), the interaction clearly results in the formation of smaller-scale secondary vortices. We term these 'stacked' vortices to reflect their (unexpected) vertical structure wherein shelf-slope water is stacked over eddy water.

* Teaching
While at MIT, I took the semester-long Teaching Methods class. I learned that it is generally more effective to have students work through a derivation primarily on their own in class with hints. Following that advice, I created worksheets that guide students through a derivation, guiding them toward important implications and reasoning for various steps. Here are the ones I have so far.
